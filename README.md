# OS-Shell-System
Simple UNIX-like shell implemented in C++ for educational purposes. It supports standard command execution, input/output redirection, piping, background processes, and command history, mimicking core functionalities of traditional shells like Bash. This project serves as a foundation for learning system-level programming, process management, and the use of UNIX system calls like fork(), execvp(), pipe(), and dup2().
